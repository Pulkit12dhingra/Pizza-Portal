# Pizza

I am a Pizza fan!!!!

Mrs Anna started a pizza van. Fershly cheeezy pizzas are on the way. But wait too many orders!!, it's not easy to write them down calculate the total...   

Mrs Anna needs some help...

Well, No problem..
Pizza portal is ment for sellers like her.
It's a portal where the customers or consumers can register them selves and order Tasty and Jouicy Pizzas just by pressing few buttons. It calculates the total price, and directs to a portal if you wan't to pay online 
Fast and Securied....

Now Mrs Anna can focus on feeding the hungry stomach.
